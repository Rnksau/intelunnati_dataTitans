Design and Implementation of ATM (FSM) Controller - Simulation Report

------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion of Tasks Performed:
------------------------------------------------------------

During the design and implementation of the ATM (FSM) controller, the following tasks were performed:

1. State Definition: The states of the ATM controller were defined based on the required functionality, including state transitions and outputs.

2. User Interface: The user interface was implemented to allow user input and display relevant information on the seven-segment display.

3. Memory Handling: A memory module was created to store account information, including account numbers, passcodes, and balances.

4. State Transitions: The ATM controller was designed to transition between states based on user input, time limits, and passcode validation.

5. Testing and Verification: Extensive testing and verification were conducted to ensure the correct functionality of the ATM controller.

------------------------------------------------------------
Tests Carried Out:
------------------------------------------------------------

The following tests were carried out to validate the design and implementation of the ATM (FSM) controller:

1. Test 1: State Transitions
   - Inputs: Simulated user inputs, button presses, and time intervals
   - Expected Outputs: Proper state transitions, correct display values, and appropriate responses to user actions
   - Result: Passed

2. Test 2: Passcode Validation
   - Inputs: Simulated user inputs of passcodes
   - Expected Outputs: Successful validation for correct passcodes and appropriate response for incorrect passcodes
   - Result: Passed

3. Test 3: Account Balance Update
   - Inputs: Simulated user inputs for withdrawal and deposit amounts
   - Expected Outputs: Proper updating of account balances and correct display of updated balances
   - Result: Passed

4. Test 4: Time Limits and Error Handling
   - Inputs: Simulated time intervals and user actions
   - Expected Outputs: Proper handling of time limits, display of error messages, and state transitions
   - Result: Passed

------------------------------------------------------------
Final Accuracy:
------------------------------------------------------------

The design and implementation of the ATM (FSM) controller have been thoroughly tested, and all the tests were passed successfully. 
The controller demonstrated accurate state transitions, proper passcode validation, correct account balance updates, and appropriate 
error handling. Therefore, the final accuracy of the ATM (FSM) controller is 100%, indicating that it meets the required functionality 
and performs as expected.
